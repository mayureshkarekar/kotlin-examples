--------------------------------------------------- WHAT IS KOTLIN? ---------------------------------------------------
Kotlin is a statically typed JVM based general purpose programming language developed by JetBrains. It is designed to
fully interoperate with Java. It is widely used in Android application development.

-------------------------------------------------- FEATURES OF KOTLIN --------------------------------------------------
1. Concise         : Kotlin is more concise and you need to write approximately 40% less code than Java.

2. Interoperability: Kotlin is highly interoperable with Java. i.e. you can call Java class's code from it and vise
                     versa.

3. Object-Oriented : It is a Object-Oriented programming language. It means it supports the concepts of Classes,
                     Objects, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

4. Feature-Rich    : Kotlin provides several advanced features like Operator overloading, Lambda expressions and Higher
                     order functions.

5. Less Error-Prone: As it is a statically typed language, it makes you able to catch errors at compile-time. Also there
                     are very less chances for NullPointerExceptions and ClassCastExceptions.

6. Open Source     : Kotlin is a open source language and its source code is available online.

------------------------------------------------ HOW KOTLIN CODE RUNS? ------------------------------------------------
Java code is complied to Byte Code (.class file) using javac compiler and then Byte Code runs in the JVM. Similarly
Kotlin code is compiled to Byte Code (.class file) using kotlinc-jvm compiler, then JVM and Kotlin-Runtime together
generates the output of Byte Code.
